The code extracts trees from point clouds.

Usage:
make all
./extractTrees data_file labels.pcd trees.pcd

Example:
./extractTrees data/oakland_part2_ac.xyz_label_conf labels.pcd trees.pcd


labels.pcd will have the labeled point cloud.

trees.pcd will store the extracted trees.

pcd files can be viewed using pcl_viewer.


Theory:

Geometric Description are calculated for every point.
Probabilistic Relaxation is applied.
Spatial filtering and smoothing.
